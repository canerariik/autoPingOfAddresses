# autoPingOfAddresses

<p> This project used python for the backend and html for the frontend. </p>

<p> IP addresses are added to the created txt file and these IPs are pinged one time at a time. </p>

<p> The number of all IPs, the number of successful IPs and the number of failed IPs were simply reflected on the web with the help of html. </p>

<p> Project runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000 for me. </p>

<p> As an experiment, 6 IPs have been tried for now, but as a code structure, pinging 200-300 IPs has been coded to complete the ping process in a short time. </p>
